 abstract = {Aim. The authors report their experience regarding the treatment of skin melanoma and also examine the various factors that may influence prognosis. Methods. Ten patients aged between 28 and 76 years old underwent surgery for malignant skin melanoma at the General Vascular Surgery Operating Unit of the Municipal Hospital in Lamezia Terme between January 1998 and January 1999. Results. Surgery consisted of local excision through the full thickness of normal skin surrounding the lesion. Elective lymphadenectomy was also performed in one patient with clinically manifest metastasis. A skin expander was inserted in one patient with a leg lesion. The fascia was only removed in lesions > 1.5 mm thick (1 case). No, locoregional recidivation was reported one year after surgery. Conclusions. This study confirms that surgery is the elective treatment for melanoma, at least in those cases which have not crossed regional barriers. The study illustrates the surgical technique developed by the authors to guarantee radical surgery and acceptable cosmetic results.},
