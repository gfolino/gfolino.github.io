 abstract = {An extension of Cellular Genetic Programming for data classification to induce an ensemble of predictors is presented. Each classifier is trained on a different subset of the overall data, then they are combined to classify new tuples by applying a simple majority voting algorithm, like bagging. Preliminary results on a large data set show that the ensemble of classifiers trained on a sample of the data obtains higher accuracy than a single classifier that uses the entire data set at a much lower computational cost. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},
