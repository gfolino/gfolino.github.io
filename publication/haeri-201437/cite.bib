 abstract = {In this chapter, a new GP-based algorithm is proposed. The algorithm, named SGP (Statistical GP), exploits statistical information, i.e. mean, variance and correlation-based operators, in order to improve the GP performance. SGP incorporates new genetic operators, i.e. Correlation Based Mutation, Correlation Based Crossover, and Variance Based Editing, to drive the search process towards fitter and shorter solutions. Furthermore, this work investigates the correlation between diversity and fitness in SGP, both in terms of phenotypic and genotypic diversity. First experiments conducted on four symbolic regression problems illustrate the goodness of the approach and permits to verify the different behavior of SGP in comparison with standard GP from the point of view of the diversity and its correlation with the fitness. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},
