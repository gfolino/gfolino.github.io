 abstract = {This paper presents, evaluates and compares the performance of the point-to-point and broadcast communication primitives of the MPI-1 standard library on the Meiko CS-2 parallel machine. Furthermore, a benchmark model of MPI communications is proposed. It is based on the size of messages exchanged and the number of processors involved. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.},
