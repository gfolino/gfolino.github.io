 abstract = {A new parallel implementation of genetic programming based on the cellular model is presented and compared with the island model approach. Although the widespread belief that cellular model is not suitable for parallel genetic programming implementations, experimental results show a better convergence with respect to the island approach, a good scale-up behaviour and a nearly linear speed-up. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.},
