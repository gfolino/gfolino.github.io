 abstract = {In this paper an intrusion detection algorithm based on GP ensembles is proposed. The algorithm runs on a distributed hybrid multi-island model-based environment to monitor security-related activity within a network. Each island contains a cellular genetic program whose aim is to generate a decision-tree predictor, trained on the local data stored in the node. Every genetic program operates cooperatively, yet independently by the others, by taking advantage of the cellular model to exchange the outmost individuals of the population. After the classifiers are computed, they are collected to form the GP ensemble. Experiments on the KDD Cup 1999 Data show the validity of the approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},
