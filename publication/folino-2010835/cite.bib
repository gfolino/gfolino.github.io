 abstract = {March 2010 Special Issue of Future Generation Computer Systems journal presents some papers on bio-inspired algorithms for distributed systems. The presented algorithms are tailored for specific domains, including P2P and Grid systems, and also rapidly evolving infrastructures such as Clouds and sensor networks. The papers by Brocco et al., and by Bicocchi and coworkers are directly inspired by phenomena observed in ant colonies. The papers by De Falco and researchers and by González et al., take inspiration from the evolutionary behavior of natural systems, and focus on two variants of evolutionary algorithms, namely, Differential Evolution algorithms, and Parallel Genetic Programming (GP). The papers included in this special session confirm that bioinspired algorithms naturally provide such characteristics as decentralization, self-organization, flexibility and energy saving that are essential to efficiently cope with the ever increasing complexity of current and future distributed systems.},
