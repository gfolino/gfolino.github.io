 abstract = {This paper describes a distributed framework for supporting adaptive ensemble-based intrusion detection. Open issues and limitations of actual state-of-the-art proposals, are analyzed and the main functionalities of a suitable architecture that, based on actual, emerging research trends, finally defines an innovative ensemble-based network intrusion detection system. © 2016, Sistemi Evoluti per Basi di Dati (SEBD).
