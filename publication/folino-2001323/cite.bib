 abstract = {A parallel hybrid method for solving the satisfiability (SAT) problem that combines cellular genetic algorithms (GAs) and the random walk SAT (WSAT) strategy of greedy SAT (GSAT) is presented. The method, called cellular genetic WSAT (CGWSAT), uses a cellular GA to perform a global search from a random initial population of candidate solutions and a local selective generation of new strings. Global search is then specialized in local search by adopting the WSAT strategy. A main characteristic of the method is that it indirectly provides a parallel implementation of WSAT when the probability of crossover is set to zero. CGWSAT has been implemented on a Meiko CS-2 parallel machine using a two-dimensional cellular automaton as a parallel computation model. The algorithm has been tested on randomly generated problems and some classes of problems from the DIMACS and SATLIB test set.},
