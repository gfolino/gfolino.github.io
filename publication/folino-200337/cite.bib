 abstract = {A new parallel Implementation of genetic programming (GP) based on the cellular model is presented and compared with both canonical GP and the island model approach. The method adopts a load-balancing policy that avoids the unequal utilization of the processors. Experimental results on benchmark problems of different complexity show the superiority of the cellular approach with respect to the canonical sequential implementation and the island model. A theoretical performance analysis reveals the high scalability of the implementation realized and allows to predict the size of the population when the number of processors and their efficiency are fixed.},
