 abstract = {In this paper we present CAMELotGRID, a middleware ' architecture to manage grid computations of Cellular Automata that support the efficient simulation of complex systems modelled by a very large number of simple elements (cells) with local interaction only. The study of these systems has generated great interest over the years because of their ability to generate a rich spectrum of very complex patterns of behavior out of sets of relatively simple underlying rules. Moreover, they appear to capture many essential features of complex self-organizing cooperative behavior observed in real systems. The middleware architecture of CAMELotGrid is designed according to an autonomic approach on top of the existing Grid middleware and supports dynamic performance adaptation of the cellular application without any user intervention. The user must only specify, by global criteria, the high level policies and submit the application for execution over the Grid.},
