 abstract = {Cyber security classification algorithms usually operate with datasets presenting many missing features and strongly unbalanced classes. In order to cope with these issues, we designed a distributed genetic programming (GP) framework, named CAGE-MetaCombiner, which adopts a meta-ensemble model to operate efficiently with missing data. Each ensemble evolves a function for combining the classifiers, which does not need of any extra phase of training on the original data. Therefore, in the case of changes in the data, the function can be recomputed in an incremental way, with a moderate computational effort; this aspect together with the advantages of running on parallel/distributed architectures makes the algorithm suitable to operate with the real time constraints typical of a cyber security problem. In addition, an important cyber security problem that concerns the classification of the users or the employers of an e-payment system is illustrated, in order to show the relevance of the case in which entire sources of data or groups of features are missing. Finally, the capacity of approach in handling groups of missing features and unbalanced datasets is validated on many artificial datasets and on two real datasets and it is compared with some similar approaches. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
