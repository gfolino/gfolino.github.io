 abstract = {Modern smartphones permit to run a large variety of applications, i.e. multimedia, games, social network applications, etc. However, this aspect considerably reduces the battery life of these devices. A possible solution to alleviate this problem is to offload part of the application or the whole computation to remote servers, i.e. Cloud Computing. The offloading cannot be performed without considering the issues derived from the nature of the application (i.e. multimedia, games, etc.), which can considerably change the resources necessary to the computation and the type, the frequency and the amount of data to be exchanged with the network. This work shows a framework for automatically building models for the offloading of mobile applications based on evolutionary algorithms and how it can be used to simulate different kinds of mobile applications and to analyze the rules generated. To this aim, a tool for generating mobile datasets, presenting different features, is designed and experiments are performed in different usage conditions in order to demonstrate the utility of the overall framework. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},
