 abstract = {An extension of Cellular Genetic Programming for data classification with the boosting technique is presented and a comparison with the bagging-like majority voting approach is performed. The method is able to deal with large data sets that do not fit in main memory since each classifier is trained on a subset of the overall training data. Experiments showed that, by using a sample of reasonable size, the extension with these voting algorithms enhances classification accuracy at a much lower computational cost. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},
