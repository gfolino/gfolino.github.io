 abstract = {Background. The authors made a critical review of gastroesophageal reflux surgery in which they examine the wide variety of surgical techniques used to correct gastroesophageal flow. Methods. The authors make a detailed review of international literature to evaluate the goals set by the surgeon in order to guarantee a successful outcome and the different surgical techniques that are most widely used. The latter are compared in order to highlight their particular characteristics and the results obtained by different authors. This serves to highlight a number of unique techniques and valid results that should be borne in mind during clinical practice. Results. Given that a wide range of surgical techniques are proposed and used to correct gastroesophageal reflux, the authors felt that it was worthwhile identifying the state of the art of this form of surgery. Conclusions. Having made a critical review of international literature the authors conclude that the majority of surgeons prefer to choose between one or two forms of surgery: total fundoplication according to Nissen and partial fundoplication according to Toupet. Both techniques produce comparable short and medium-term results. However, Nissen's technique offers a better long-term guarantee, despite its association with a higher incidence of collateral effects.},
