 abstract = {Grid computing has emerged as an important new field in the distributed computing arena. It focus on intensive resource sharing, innovative applications, and in some cases, high-performance orientation. This paper describes how grids technologies can be used to develop an infrastructure for developing geoprocessing applications. We present the MOSÈ system, a grid-enabled problem solving environment (PSE) able to support the activities that concern the modelling and simulation of spatio-temporal phenomena for analyzing and managing the identification and the mitigation of natural disasters like floods, wildfires, landslides, etc. MOSÈ takes advantages of the standardized resource access and workflow support for loosely coupled software components provided by the web/grid services technologies. © Società Italiana di Fisica.},
