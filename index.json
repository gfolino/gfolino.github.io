Promptly detecting such deceptive content with the help of Machine Learning models is crucial, yet it comes with the challenge of dealing with labelled examples for training these models. Impressive performance results were recently achieved by high-capacity pre-trained transformer-based models (e.g., BERT). Still, such models are too data- and compute-demanding for many critical application contexts where memory, time, and energy consumption must be limited. Here, we propose an innovative semi-supervised method for efficient and effective fake news detection using a content-oriented classifier based on a small-sized BERT embedder. After fine-tuning this model on the sole few labelled data available, an iterative Active Learning (AL) process is carried out, which benefits from limited experts’ feedback to acquire more labelled data for improving the model. The proposed method ensures good detection performances using a few training samples, reasonably small human intervention, and compute/memory costs. © The Author(s) 2024.","tags":[],"title":"Towards Data- and Compute-Efficient Fake-News Detection: An Approach Combining Active Learning and Pre-Trained Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

In cybersecurity, human behaviour is responsible directly or indirectly for the most common attacks (i.e. ransomware and phishing). To monitor user behaviour, it is necessary to process fast user logs coming from different and heterogeneous sources, having part of the data or some entire sources missing. A framework based on the elastic stack (ELK) to process and store log data in real time from different users and applications is proposed for this aim. This system generates an ensemble of models to classify user behaviour and detect anomalies in real time, exploiting the advantages of the ELK-based software architecture and of the Kubernetes platform. In addition, a distributed evolutionary algorithm is used to classify the users by exploiting their digital footprints derived from many data sources.

However, this information is typically unverified and/or interpreted according to the point of view of the publisher. Consequently, malicious users can leverage these unofficial channels to share misleading or false news to manipulate the opinion of the readers and make fake news viral. In this scenario, early detection of this malicious information is challenging as it requires coping with several issues (e.g., scarcity of labelled data, unbalanced class distribution, and efficient handling of raw data). To address all these issues, in this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Deep Learning based approach that allows for discovering accurate and effective Fake News Detection models. By embedding a BERT model in a pseudo-labelling procedure, the approach can yield reliable detection models also when a limited number of examples are available.

Data gathered from Rain Gauges (RGs), sensors devoted to measuring the intensity of the rain at individual points, are commonly used to feed interpolation methods (e.g., the Kriging geostatistical approach) and estimate the precipitation field over an area of interest. However, the information provided by RGs could be insufficient to model complex phenomena, and computationally expensive interpolation methods could not be used in real-time environments. Integrating additional data sources (e.g., radar and geostationary satellites) is an effective solution for improving the quality of the estimate, but it needs to cope with Big Data issues. To overcome all these issues, we propose a Rainfall Estimation Model (REM) based on an Ensemble of Deep Neural Networks (DeepEns-REM) that can automatically fuse heterogeneous data sources. The usage of Residual Blocks in the base models and the adoption of a Snapshot procedure to build the ensemble guarantees a fast convergence and scalability.

Dense networks of sensors, named rain gauges (RGs), are typically used to obtain direct measurements of precipitation intensity in these points. These measurements are usually interpolated by using spatial interpolation methods for estimating the precipitation field over the entire area of interest. However, these methods are computationally expensive, and to improve the estimation of the variable of interest in unknown points, it is necessary to integrate further information. To overcome these issues, this work proposes a machine learning-based methodology that exploits a classifier based on ensemble methods for rainfall estimation and is able to integrate information from different remote sensing measurements. The proposed approach supplies an accurate estimate of the rainfall where RGs are not available, permits the integration of heterogeneous data sources exploiting both the high quantitative precision of RGs and the spatial pattern recognition ensured by radars and satellites, and is computationally less expensive than the interpolation methods. Experimental results, conducted on real data concerning an Italian region, Calabria, show a significant improvement in comparison with Kriging with external drift (KED), a well-recognized method in the field of rainfall estimation, both in terms of the probability of detection (0.58 versus 0.48) and mean-square error (0.11 versus 0.15).  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","tags":[],"title":"A Machine Learning Approach for Rainfall Estimation Integrating Heterogeneous Data Sources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","Carla Otranto Godano","Francesco Sergio Pisani"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"d9e4d46548974543f3aa25c10908cca3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-2022189/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:44.489675Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-2022189/","section":"publication","summary":"Large user and application logs are generated and stored by many organisations at a rate that makes it really hard to analyse, especially in real-Time.

However, a supervised learning strategy is unsuitable for important application scenarios where the outcome labels are known only for a small fraction of log traces. In order to address these challenging scenarios, a semi-supervised learning approach is proposed here, which leverages a multi-target DNN model supporting both outcome prediction and the additional auxiliary task of next-activity prediction.

Basically, the non-stationary nature of IDS log data is faced by maintaining an ensemble consisting of a number of specialized base DNN classifiers, trained on disjoint chunks of the data instances’ stream, plus a combiner model (reasoning on both the base classifiers predictions and original instance features). In order to learn deep base classifiers effectively from small training samples, an ad-hoc shared DNN architecture is adopted, featuring a combination of dropout capabilities, skip-connections, along with a cost-sensitive loss (for dealing with unbalanced data). Tests results, conducted on two benchmark IDS datasets and involving several competitors, confirmed the effectiveness of our proposal (in terms of both classification accuracy and robustness to data scarcity), and allowed us to evaluate different ensemble combination schemes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","tags":[],"title":"On learning effective ensembles of deep neural networks for intrusion detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

To this aim, here, a distributed genetic programming (GP) tool is used to generate the combiner function of an ensemble; this tool does not need a heavy additional training phase, once the classifiers composing the ensemble have been trained, and it can hence answer quickly to concept drifts, also in the case of fast-changing data streams. The above-described approach is integrated into a novel cybersecurity framework for classifying non stationary and unbalanced data streams. The framework provides mechanisms for detecting drifts and for replacing classifiers, which permits to build the ensemble in an incremental way.

However, the data produced by modern system/network logs pose many problems, such as the streaming and non-stationary nature of such data, their volume and velocity, and the presence of imbalanced classes. Classifier ensembles look a valid solution for this scenario, owing to their flexibility and scalability. In particular, data-driven schemes for combining the predictions of multiple classifiers have been shown superior to traditional fixed aggregation criteria (e.g., predictions’ averaging and weighted voting). In intrusion detection settings, however, such schemes must be devised in an efficient way, since (part of) the ensemble may need to be re-trained frequently. A novel ensemble-based framework is proposed here for the online intrusion detection, where the ensemble is updated through an incremental stream-oriented learning scheme, correspondingly to the detection of concept drifts. Differently from mainstream ensemble-based approaches in the field, our proposal relies on deriving, though an efficient genetic programming (GP) method, an expressive kind of combiner function defined in terms of (non-trainable) aggregation functions. This approach is supported by a system architecture, which integrates different kinds of functionalities, ranging from the drift detection, to the induction and replacement of base classifiers, up to the distributed computation of GP-based combiners. Experiments on both artificial and real-life datasets confirmed the validity of the approach. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","tags":[],"title":"A GP-based ensemble classification framework for time-changing streams of intrusion detection data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Folino","Gianluigi Folino","Massimo Guarascio","Luigi Pontieri"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9cdb8960fcfdc1fb7c2c6025f4c25d1d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-2020249/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:45.298899Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-2020249/","section":"publication","summary":"Mining deviances from expected behaviors in process logs is a relevant problem in modern organizations, owing to their negative impact in terms of monetary/reputation losses. Most proposals to deviance mining combine the extraction of behavioral features from log traces with the induction of standard classifiers. Difficulties in capturing the multi-faceted nature of deviances with a single pattern family led to explore the possibility to mix up heterogeneous data views, obtained each with a different pattern family. Unfortunately, combining many pattern families tends to produce sparse and redundant representations that likely lead to the discovery of poor deviance-oriented classifiers. Using a multi-view ensemble learning approach to combine alternative trace representations was recently proven effective for this induction task. On the other hand, Deep Learning methods have been gaining momentum in prediction/classification tasks on process log data, owing to their flexibility and expressiveness. We here propose a novel multi-view ensemble-based framework for the discovery of deviance-oriented classifiers that profitably combines different single-view deep classifiers, sharing an ad hoc residual-like architecture (simulating fine-grain ensemble-like capabilities over each single data view).

A wide range of machine-learning techniques (and possible alternative configurations of them) have been proposed in the literature so far, for this purpose, but none of them has been proven to consistently overcome the others across different datasets. In order to ensure better accuracy and stability, the ensemble paradigm can be exploited as an effective solution for combining such techniques. However, as attack detection problems are hard to cope with and, usually, entail the analysis of large and fast streams of data, different types of ensemble (and of base algorithms composing the ensemble) should have experimented, exploiting distributed architecture to suitably reduce the high-execution times necessary to run them. In order to handle all these issues, a p2p environment to validate ensemble-based approaches in the cybersecurity domain is proposed in this paper. Two case studies are analyzed by using this framework, which concern the detection of intrusions in network-traffic data and of deviant process instances.

However, interpolation methods need to work with real-time data, and therefore can be hardly used in real-time scenarios. To overcome this issue, we propose a general machine learning framework, which can be trained offline, based on a deep learning architecture, also integrating information derived from remote sensing measurements such as weather radars and satellites. The framework allows to provide accurate estimations of the rainfall in the areas where no rain gauge data is available.

However, these approaches rely on a pure supervised learning scheme, and unfit many real-life scenarios where the outcome of (fully unfolded) training traces must be provided by experts. Indeed, since in such a scenario only a small amount of labeled traces are usually given, there is a risk that an inaccurate or overfitting model is discovered. To overcome these issues, a novel outcome-discovery approach is proposed here, which leverages a fine-tuning strategy that learns general-enough trace representations from unlabelled log traces, which are then reused (and adapted) in the discovery of the outcome predictor.

In this ongoing work, we describe an approach aimed at understanding whether an ensemble of outlier algorithms can be used to detect effectively new types of attacks in intrusion detection systems. In particular, Genetic Programming (GP) is adopted to build the combining function of an ensemble of local and global outlier detection algorithms, which are used to detect different types of attack. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the well-known NSL-KDD dataset, are encouraging and confirm that, depending on the type of attacks, it would be better to use only local or only global detection algorithms and that the GP-based ensemble improves the performance in comparison with commonly used combining functions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","tags":[],"title":"Using genetic programming for combining an ensemble of local and global outlier algorithms to detect new attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Folino","Gianluigi Folino","Luigi Pontieri"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"32cfb992fd2b144ced2767b6e2fee3b4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-2018122/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:45.665263Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-2018122/","section":"publication","summary":"The problem of discriminating 'deviant' traces (i.e.Traces diverging from normal/desired outcomes, such as frauds, faults) in the execution log of a business process can be faced by extracting a classification model for the traces, after mapping them onto some suitable feature space. An ensemble-learning approach was recently proposed that trains multiple base learners on different vector-space views of the given log, and a probabilistic meta-model that combines the predictions of the discovered base classifiers. However, the sequential centralised implementation of this learning approach makes it unsuitable for real applications, where large volumes of traces are produced continuously, while both deviant and normal behaviours tend to change over the time. We here propose an online deviance detection framework that leverages a novel incremental learning scheme, which extracts different base models from different chunks of a trace stream, and dynamically combines them in an ensemble model. Notably, the system is based on a p2p architecture that allows it to distribute the entire learning procedure among multiple nodes and to exploit the power of HPC resources (e.g. cloud computing environments). Preliminary tests on a real-life log confirmed the validity of the approach, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. © 2018 IEEE.","tags":[],"title":"An ensemble-based P2P framework for the detection of deviant business process instances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","Giuseppe A.

To identify the key vulnerabilities associated with the user behavior and to implement a number of measures useful to protect the payment systems against these kinds of vulnerability is a real hard task. To this aim, we designed an architecture useful to divide the users of a payment system into pre-defined classes according to the type of vulnerability enabled. In this way, it is possible to address actions (information campaigns, alerts, etc.) towards targeted users of a specific group. Unfortunately, the data useful to classify the user typically presents many missing features. To overcome this issue, a tool was developed, based on artificial intelligence and adopting a meta-ensemble model, to operate efficiently with missing data. Each ensemble evolves a function for combining the classifiers, which does not need of any extra phase of training on the original data.

However, if the code is parallelized by partitioning the space of the automata, these synchronization requirements can be relaxed: indeed, a node that manages a given portion of the cellular automata can execute a new step after synchronizing only with the nodes that manage the adjacent portions, while the remaining nodes can execute different time steps. This can be a notable advantage in many novel and increasingly popular applications of cellular automata, such as smart city applications, simulation of natural phenomena, etc., in which the execution times can be different and variable, due to the heterogeneity of machines and/or of the data and/or of the different functions. Indeed, a longer execution time at a node does not slow down the execution at all the other nodes but only at the neighboring nodes. This is particularly advantageous when the nodes that act as a bottleneck can vary during the execution.

Data mining techniques and, in particular, ensemble of classifiers permit to combine different classifiers that together provide complementary information and can be built in an incremental way. This paper introduces the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection framework and in particular, the detector module based on a meta-ensemble, which is used to cope with the problem of detecting intrusions, in which typically the number of attacks is minor than the number of normal connections. To this aim, we explore the usage of ensembles specialized to detect particular types of attack or normal connections, and Genetic Programming is adopted to generate a non-trainable function to combine each specialized ensemble. Nontrainable functions can be evolved without any extra phase of training and, therefore, they are particularly apt to handle concept drifts, also in the case of real-time constraints.

Even if the offloading of computation onto cloud computing platforms can considerably extend battery duration, it is really hard not only to evaluate the cases where offloading guarantees real advantages on the basis of the requirements of the application in terms of data transfer, computing power needed, etc., but also to evaluate whether user requirements (i.e. the costs of using the cloud services, a determined QoS required, etc.) are satisfied. To this aim, this paper presents a framework for generating models to make automatic decisions on the offloading of mobile applications using a genetic programming (GP) approach. The GP system is designed using a taxonomy of the properties useful to the offloading process concerning the user, the network, the data and the application. The fitness function adopted permits different weights to be given to the four categories considered during the process of building the model.

The proposed framework, named WS-Chord, includes a taxonomy of data mining services used to annotate the WSs, and an extension of the Chord DHT protocol to efficiently index and discover annotated WSs.

In this paper we investigate how well different technologies represent information related to a considered organism of interest in a metagenome, and whether it is beneficial to combine information obtained using different technologies. We analyze comparatively three metagenomic datasets acquired from a sample containing the anammox bacterium Candidatus 'Brocadia fulgida' (B. fulgida). These datasets were obtained using Roche 454 FLX and Sanger sequencing with two different libraries (shotgun and fosmid). Results: In each dataset, the abundance of the reads annotated to B. fulgida was much lower than the abundance expected from available cell count information. This was due to the overrepresentation of GC-richer organisms, as shown by GC-content distribution of the reads. Nevertheless, by considering the union of B. fulgida reads over the three datasets, the number of B. fulgida ORFs recovered for at least 80% of their length was twice the amount recovered by the best technology. Indeed, while taxonomic distributions of reads in the three datasets were similar, the respective sets of B. fulgida ORFs recovered for a large part of their length were highly different, and depth of coverage patterns of 454 and Sanger were dissimilar. Conclusions: Precautions should be sought in order to prevent the overrepresentation of GC-rich microbes in the datasets. This overrepresentation and the consistency of the taxonomic distributions of reads obtained with different sequencing technologies suggests that, in general, abundance biases might be mainly due to other steps of the sequencing protocols. Results show that biases against organisms of interest could be compensated combining different sequencing technologies, due to the differences of their genome-level sequencing biases even if the species was present in not very different abundances in the metagenomes. © 2013 Gori et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","tags":[],"title":"Differences in sequencing technologies improve the retrieval of anammox bacterial genome from metagenomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","Carlo Mastroianni","Sanaz Mostaghim"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"e873bebbc7993aa616895360750af970","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-201327/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:44.675654Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-201327/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"Preface: Nature inspired solutions for high performance computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","Carlo Mastroianni","Sanaz Mostaghim","Junichi Suzuki"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"efd4c0c470c16fb4ae355b42f4ee8562","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-2011-iii/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:45.503573Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-2011-iii/","section":"publication","summary":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.","tags":[],"title":"8th International Conference on Autonomic Computing, ICAC 2011 Co-located Workshops - Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Biologically Inspired Algorithms for Distributed Systems, BADS 2011: Foreword","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Gori","Gianluigi Folino","Mike S.M.

A metagenomic dataset consists of many short DNA or RNA fragments called reads. One interesting problem in metagenomic data analysis is the discovery of the taxonomic composition of a given dataset. A simple method for this task, called the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), is employed in state-of-the-art computational tools for metagenomic data analysis of very short reads (about 100 bp). However LCA has two main drawbacks: it possibly assigns many reads to high taxonomic ranks and it discards a high number of reads. Results: We present MTR, a new method for tackling these drawbacks using clustering at Multiple Taxonomic Ranks. Unlike LCA, which processes the reads one-by-one, MTR exploits information shared by reads. Specifically, MTR consists of two main phases. First, for each taxonomic rank, a collection of potential clusters of reads is generated, and each potential cluster is associated to a taxon at that rank. Next, a small number of clusters is selected at each rank using a combinatorial optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the resulting method is tested on a large number of simulated and real-life metagenomes. Results of experiments show that MTR improves on LCA by discarding a significantly smaller number of reads and by assigning much more reads at lower taxonomic ranks. Moreover, MTR provides a more faithful taxonomic characterization of the metagenome population distribution. © The Author(s) 2010.

However, the availability of cheaper and better-performing distributed and parallel architectures make it possible to deal with complex problems previously hardly solved owing to the large amount of time necessary. This work presents a general framework based on a distributed GP ensemble algorithm for coping with different types of concept drift for the task of classification of large data streams. The framework is able to detect changes in a very efficient way using only a detection function based on the incoming unclassified data. Thus, only if a change is detected a distributed GP algorithm is performed in order to improve classification accuracy and this limits the overhead associated with the use of a population-based method. Real world data streams may present drifts of different types. The introduced detection function, based on the self-similarity fractal dimension, permits to cope in a very short time with the main types of different drifts, as demonstrated by the first experiments performed on some artificial datasets.

Each of these applications, as well as many others where molecular comparison plays an important role, requires a different notion of similarity that naturally lead to the multicriteria PSC (MC-PSC) problem. Protein (Structure) Comparison, Knowledge, Similarity, and Information (ProCKSI) (www.procksi.org) provides algorithmic solutions for the MC-PSC problem by means of an enhanced structural comparison that relies on the principled application of information fusion to similarity assessments derived from multiple comparison methods. Current MC-PSC works well for moderately sized datasets and it is time consuming as it provides public service to multiple users. Many of the structural bioinformatics applications mentioned above would benefit from the ability to perform, for a dedicated user, thousands or tens of thousands of comparisons through multiple methods in real time, a capacity beyond our current technology. In this paper, we take a key step into that direction by means of a high-throughput distributed reimplementation of ProCKSI for very large datasets. The core of the proposed framework lies in the design of an innovative distributed algorithm that runs on each compute node in a cluster/grid environment to perform structure comparison of a given subset of input structures using some of the most popular PSC methods [e.g., universal similarity metric (USM), maximum contact map overlap (MaxCMO), fast alignment and search tool (FAST), distance alignment (DaliLite), combinatorial extension (CE), template modeling alignment (TMAlign)]. We follow this with a procedure of distributed consensus building. Thus, the new algorithms proposed here achieve ProCKSIs similarity assessment quality but with a fraction of the time required by it. Our results show that the proposed distributed method can be used efficiently to compare: 1) a particular protein against a very large protein structures dataset (target-against-all comparison), and 2) a particular very large-scale dataset against itself or against another very large-scale dataset (all-against-all comparison).

In this paper we focus on clustering methods and their application to taxonomic analysis of metagenomic data. Clustering analysis for metagenomics amounts to group similar partial sequences, such as raw sequence reads, into clusters in order to discover information about the internal structure of the considered dataset, or the relative abundance of protein families. Different methods for clustering analysis of metagenomic datasets have been proposed. Here we focus on evidence-based methods for clustering that employ knowledge extracted from proteins identified by a BLASTx search (proxygenes). We consider two clustering algorithms introduced in previous works and a new one. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of the algorithms, and use them to perform taxonomic analysis of metagenomic data. To this aim, three real-life benchmark datasets used in previous work on metagenomic data analysis are used. Comparison of the results indicates satisfactory coherence of the taxonomies output by the three algorithms, with respect to phylogenetic content at the class level and taxonomic distribution at phylum level. In general, the experimental comparative analysis substantiates the effectiveness of evidence-based clustering methods for taxonomic analysis of metagenomic data. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","tags":[],"title":"Evidence-based clustering of reads and taxonomic analysis of metagenomic data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","Azhar Ali Shah","Natalio Kransnogor"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"d39b9614e8aec605a002700f8a1a4a9c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-2009/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:45.281527Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"Assessment of the (Multi) Similarity among a set of protein structures is achieved through an ensemble of protein structure comparison methods/algorithms.

As the number of proteins in the dataset increases, the corresponding computational time taken by the protein structure comparison algorithms also increases, squarely for an all-against-all comparison and linearly for an all-against-target assessment. Thus ever larger proteomics problems call for the distribution of pairwise comparison jobs in the form of well granulated subsets/packages to be run in parallel on a pool of networked processors/workstations under the coordination of a Message Passing Interface (MPI) environment. This paper evaluates the effect on the performance of such jobs when the MPI environment is integrated with a Local Resource Management System (LRMS) such as Sun Grid Engine (SGE). From our experiments with different ways of integration we draw a comparative picture of all possible approaches with the description of resource usage information for each parallel job on each processor.

They are often used as an alternative to model and solve large-scale systems where the use of partial differential equations involve complex and computationally expensive simulations. The purpose of this work is to investigate the use of CA based techniques for modeling and parallel simulation of water flux in unsaturated soils. Unsaturated flow processes are an important topic in several branches of hydrology, soil science and agricultural engineering dealing with soil-atmosphere interaction, subsurface flow and transport processes. In this paper a CA model for 3D unsaturated flow simulation is proposed using an extension of the original computational paradigm of cellular automata. This model, aimed at simulating large-scale systems, uses a macroscopic CA approach where local laws with a clear physical meaning govern interactions among automata. Its correctness is proved by CAMELot system, which allows the specification, parallel simulation, visualization, steering and analysis of CA models in the same environment, using a friendly interface and providing at the same time considerable flexibility. The model has been validated with reference multidimensional solutions taken from benchmarks in literature, showing a good agreement, even in the cases where non-linearity was very marked. Furthermore, using some of these benchmarks we present a scalability analysis of the model and different quantization techniques aimed at reducing the number of messages exchanged and the execution time when simulations are characterized by scarce mass interactions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing has recently revealed as a powerful way to harness these resources and efficiently deal with such problems. In this paper, we present a P2P implementation of Genetic Programming based on the JXTA technology. To run genetic programs we use a distributed environment based on a hybrid multi-island model that combines the island model with the cellular model. Each island adopts a cellular genetic programming model and the migration occurs among neighboring peers. The implementation is based on a virtual ring topology. Three different termination criteria (effort, time and max-gen) have been implemented. Experiments on some popular benchmarks show that the approach presents a accuracy at least comparable with classical distributed models, retaining the obvious advantages in terms of decentralization, fault tolerance and scalability of P2P systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","tags":[],"title":"P-CAGE: An environment for evolutionary computation in peer-to-peer systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","Agostino Forestiero","Giandomenico Spezzano"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"3101354b3f748bb50c385072fa220ea9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-200637/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:44.219943Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-200637/","section":"publication","summary":"Clustering can be defined as the process of partitioning a set of patterns into disjoint and homogeneous meaningful groups, called clusters. Traditional clustering methods require that all data have to be located at the site where they are analyzed and cannot be applied in the case of multiple distributed datasets. This paper describes a multi-agent algorithm for clustering distributed data in a peer-to-peer environment. The algorithm proposed is based on the biology-inspired paradigm of a flock of birds. Agents, in this context, are used to discovery clusters using a density-based approach. Swarm-based algorithms have attractive features that include adaptation, robustness and a distributed, decentralized nature, making them well-suited for clustering in p2p networks, in which it is difficult to implement centralized network control. We have applied this algorithm on synthetic and real world datasets and we have measured the impact of the flocking search strategy on performance in terms of accuracy and scalability. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.","tags":[],"title":"Swarm-based distributed clustering in peer-to-peer systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","Giandomenico Spezzano"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"4697f0189a57da9a9aef1682a0ed9221","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-2005258/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:44.641166Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-2005258/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we present CAMELotGRID, a middleware ' architecture to manage grid computations of Cellular Automata that support the efficient simulation of complex systems modelled by a very large number of simple elements (cells) with local interaction only.

Regions are spatiotemporal objects that define zones of the automaton (set of cells), containing interesting and meaningful data patterns or trends that can be defined as events. Each cell of the automaton can monitor regions for a given period and observe their evolution by global functions (max, min, sum etc.). Furthermore, each cell can have an associated attribute called its perception rating, that indicates how far that cell can 'see'. On the basis of this value and the cell's position in the cellular space, we can define the regions that are visible to the cell. Using these constructs, a cell can define significant events to extract data of interest in one or more regions and perform actions when an event is detected. In the paper, we show that regions simplify programming and allow the building of more complex models. After describing the main constructs of CELLAR, the paper illustrates the region-based programming model by describing the design of a parallel model of animal migration.

The method, called CGWSAT, uses a cellular genetic algorithm to perform a global search on a random initial population of candidate solutions and a local selective generation of new strings. Global search is specialized in local search by adopting the WSAT strategy. CGWSAT has been implemented on a Meiko CS-2 parallel machine using a two-dimensional cellular automaton as parallel computation model. The algorithm has been tested on randomly generated problems and some classes of problems from the DIMACS test set.","tags":[],"title":"Combining cellular genetic algorithms and local search for solving satisfiability problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gianluigi Folino","Giandomenico Spezzano","Domenico Talia"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":883612800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":883612800,"objectID":"bc01bcf63ced5f1c76bf95fcec01b60e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/folino-199827/","publishdate":"2024-05-10T10:53:45.960092Z","relpermalink":"/publication/folino-199827/","section":"publication","summary":"The MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a standard communication library implemented on a large number of parallel computers.

It is based on a parallel cellular genetic algorithm which performs global search on a random initial population of individuals and local selective generation of new strings according to new defined genetic operators. The algorithm adopts a diffusion model of information among chromosomes by realizing a two dimensional cellular automaton. Global search is then specialized in local search by changing the assignment of a variable that leads to the greatest decrease in the total number of unsatisfied clauses. A parallel implementation of the algorithm has been realized on a CS-2 parallel machine. © 1998 IEEE.","tags":[],"title":"Solving the satisfiability problem by a parallel cellular genetic algorithm","type":"publication"}]
